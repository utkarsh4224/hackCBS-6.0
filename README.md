## Problem Statement
The current healthcare system relies on centralized databases controlled by individual hospitals, resulting in limited patient control over personal health data. Patients face challenges related to data accuracy, integrity, and sharing as a result of this centralized approach. Hospitals and healthcare institutions own and manage patient records, which can hinder patients' ability to manage and share their health information, particularly when seeking treatment at different healthcare facilities.
## Solution
To overcome the transition challenges from paper-based medical records to Electronic Health Records (EHRs), integrating blockchain technology and smart contracts is a robust solution. Blockchain ensures data security and integrity, while smart contracts automate patient-controlled EHR access, improving data sharing and enhancing healthcare efficiency.
